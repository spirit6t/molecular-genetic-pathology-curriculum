    "explanation": "Explanation:\nThe melting temperature (Tₘ) of DNA depends on the strength of hydrogen bonding between the base pairs. Guanine (G) and cytosine (C) pairs form three hydrogen bonds, whereas adenine (A) and thymine (T) pairs form only two. Therefore, DNA molecules with a higher G–C content require more energy (higher temperature) to separate the strands, resulting in a higher Tₘ.
